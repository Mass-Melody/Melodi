# Melodi

[Melodi Live Link](https://dev.d3nmhf49ophq95.amplifyapp.com)
- A Social Media Web Application based on Music to promote connection and the love of music!

## Motivation

Traditional social media platforms focus too much on displays of status, materialism, and brief ideas. The team here at Melodi created Melodi to deter people from these potential problems. By keeping a focus on music, hobbies, and interests of individuals, Melodi strives to organically build communities and meaningful connections based on passion. Whether you are an artist, musician, or music lover, Melodi provides a proactive and healthy environment to facilitate relationships centered around music.
